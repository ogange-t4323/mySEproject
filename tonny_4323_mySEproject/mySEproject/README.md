An Anroid app where doctors and patients can interact with each other. It enables the patient to book appointments, locate nearby doctors, edit their profiles as well as submit inquiries to doctors. The doctors can not only view and reply to the patient inquiries, but also view their upcoming appointments. 

Both doctors and patients can view their message history with their associated sender, however, all messages can be viewed by the admin. User accounts are created and edited by the admin as well. A cashier’s role is to remind patients with an overdue balance.

## Features

The admin will register the doctors, patients, and cashiers. Since health is important, the doctors are verified by the admin during registration. Patients can choose to register online or by the admin. They can edit their profile details. However, the admin can update accounts for all users of the app.

### Track nearby doctors (Maps API):
Patients can track doctors located near them. This is done by inserting the postal code or address in the search bar. The results will provide a list of doctors located nearby and upon selection, display their details.

### Track Patient Records:
The app will keep a record of the patient’s history which can be viewed anytime.
